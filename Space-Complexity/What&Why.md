# What is Space Complexity?
**Space complexity** is a function describing the amount of memory (space) an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm. We often speak of **extra memory** needed, not counting the memory needed to store the input itself. Again, we use natural units to measure this. Space complexity is sometimes ignored because the space used is minimal and/or obvious, however sometimes it becomes as important issue as time complexity.

## Why Space Complexity?
Space complexity also plays a crucial role in determining the **efficiency** of an algorithm/program. If an algorithm takes up a lot of time, you can still wait, run/execute it to get the desired output. But, if a program takes up a lot of memory space, the compiler will **not** let you run it.

It is the **total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program including the space of input values for execution**. So to find space complexity, it is enough to calculate the space occupied by the variables used in an algorithm/program. But often, people confuse **Space complexity** with **Auxiliary space**. Auxiliary space is just a temporary or extra space and it is not the same as space complexity. 
In simpler terms,
***Space Complexity = Auxiliary space + Space use by input values***

Important Note: **The best algorithm/program should have the lease space complexity. The lesser the space used, the faster it executes.**

# How to calculate Space Complexity of an Algorithm?
### Example 1:
#include<stdio.h>\
int main()\
{\
  int a = 5, b = 5, c;\
  c = a + b;\
  printf("%d", c);\
}
#### Output :

**Explanation:** In the above program, 3 integer variables are used. The size of the integer data type is 2 or 4 bytes which depends on the compiler. Now, lets assume the size as 4 bytes. So, the total space occupied by the above-given program is 4 * 3 = 12 bytes. Since no additional variables are used, no extra space is required. Hence, **space complexity for the above-given program is O(1), or constant.**\

### Example 2:
#include <stdio.h>\
int main()\
{\
  int n, i, sum = 0;\
  scanf("%d", &n);\
  int arr[n];\
  for(i = 0; i < n; i++)\
  {\
    scanf("%d", &arr[i]);\
    sum = sum + arr[i];\
  }\
  printf("%d", sum);\
}
#### Output:

**Explanation:** In the above-given code, the array consists of n integer elements. So, the space occupied by the array is 4 * n. Also we have integer variables such as n, i and sum. Assuming 4 bytes for each variable, the total space occupied by the program is 4n + 12 bytes. Since the highest order of n in the equation 4n + 12 is n, **so the space complexity is O(n) or linear.**\
